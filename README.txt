To test the program:
1. Go to QtCreator and click "Create Project".
2. Select "Qt Widgets Application".
3. The next step is to create the path to your project, but the path does not matter.
4. Select build system "CMake".
5. For the next step, change the class name to "BankUI". This step is very important because the files have the same name as this.
6. Translation can be left unchanged.
7. The kit used for this project was "Desktop Qt 6.6.1 MinGW 64-bit".
8. Summary can be left unchanged.
9. Once the project has been created, copy the following files from my branch into your project's path:

Bank.h
bankui.cpp
bankui.h
bankui.ui
CoinBank.h
DollarBank.h
main.cpp
Money.h
